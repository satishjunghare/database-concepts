# Q1. Commission Percentage

### Context:

GlobalTech Solutions is a multinational company with thousands of employees spread across various departments.

The company's Human Resources (HR) department maintains a comprehensive database to manage employee information, including personal details, employment history, and departmental affiliations.

In the companyt's database, we have a table named employees that stores information about our company's employees, including their commission rate (commission_pct). This commission rate is a percentage of the total sales an employee makes that they earn as a commission.

The commission_pct column may contain NULL values for some employees, indicating a missing commission rate. We want to standardize the commission_pct column to ensure consistency and simplify calculations.

### Problem Statement:

Write a SQL query that achieves the following:
- For any employee with a missing commission rate (NULL in commission_pct), we want to set their commission rate to 0%.
- We want to round all commission rates (including the newly set zeros) to two decimal places. This ensures a consistent format for all commission rates.
- For employees with existing commission rates (not null), we want to keep their current rate but ensure it's rounded to two decimal places.
- Once the updates are made, we want the data to be sorted by employee_id in ascending order for easier reference.

## Solutions:

### Using ```CASE WHEN```
```
SELECT
   employee_id,
   CASE
      WHEN commission_pct IS NULL THEN '0'
      ELSE ROUND(commission_pct, 2)
   END as commission_pct
from employees
order by employee_id asc;
```

- CASE WHEN commission_pct IS NULL THEN '0' returns a string ('0'), while ROUND(commission_pct, 2) returns a numeric value.
- This creates inconsistent data types in the commission_pct column.
- The CASE statement requires checking each row explicitly, whereas COALESCE() is built into query execution plans for better efficiency.


### Using ```COALESCE```
```
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    COALESCE(ROUND(commission_pct, 2), 0) AS commission_pct
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;
```

- COALESCE(ROUND(commission_pct, 2), 0) replaces NULL with 0 in a single function call, which is more efficient than a CASE statement.
- Improves performance, especially on large datasets.
- Ensures numeric consistency (avoids mixing strings and numbers).
- Many databases optimize COALESCE() internally, making it faster than CASE WHEN.

## Best Practice
- Use COALESCE() for NULL handling instead of CASE
- Keep data types consistent (avoid returning strings when dealing with numeric values).
- This optimized query runs faster, is easier to read, and is best practice in SQL
